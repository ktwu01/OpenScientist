# @openscientist/extract-knowhow-codex

> Automatically extract **research skills** from Codex CLI conversation history and submit them to [OpenScientist](https://github.com/OpenScientists/OpenScientist).

## What It Does

When you use Codex CLI for scientific research — data analysis, paper writing, experiment design, theoretical derivation — your conversations contain valuable tacit knowledge: judgment calls, abandoned approaches, tool choices, and reasoning patterns.

`/extract-knowhow` extracts three types of cognitive memory from your research sessions:

- **Procedural memory:** IF-THEN rules for navigating research impasses (e.g., "IF gradient explodes THEN check learning rate before architecture")
- **Semantic memory:** Domain facts that LLMs don't reliably know (e.g., calibration constants, undocumented tool behaviors)
- **Episodic memory:** Concrete research episodes capturing what was tried, what failed, and what was learned

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @openscientist/extract-knowhow-codex
```

This installs the skill automatically:
- **Codex CLI** → `~/.codex/skills/extract-knowhow/SKILL.md`

## Usage

```
/extract-knowhow
```

The command runs a 7-stage pipeline:

1. **Scan** — discover all Codex CLI sessions
2. **Classify** — identify research vs. engineering projects
3. **Extract** — extract research skills per session, organized by cognitive memory type
4. **Clean** — review extracted skills: reject engineering content, fix PII, merge duplicates
5. **Score** — assess each skill's value on 3 dimensions (procedural / semantic / episodic, 0-5)
6. **Finalize** — upload cleaned, scored skills to [researchskills.ai](https://researchskills.ai)
7. **Summary** — report results with review statistics

## Output

Each skill is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter, including three review scores:

```yaml
---
name: gradient-explosion-diagnosis
memory_type: procedural
subtype: operator-fail
llm_score: 4
review_scores:
  procedural: 4   # decision frameworks AI doesn't know
  semantic: 2      # facts/beliefs AI doesn't have
  episodic: 3      # concrete research experiences
tags: [gradient-descent, debugging, neural-networks]
domain: computer-science
subdomain: machine-learning
contributor: anon-7f3b42c9
---

## When
Using Adam or SGD with deep networks; loss spikes unpredictably.

## Decision
Check learning rate first (most common cause), not architecture.

## Local Verifiers
- nan_count in gradients > threshold
- loss jump > 10x in single step

## Failure Handling
If gradient norm clipping doesn't fix: check batch normalization placement
```

## Contributing Back

After extraction, an interactive review page opens at `researchskills.ai/review/batch/<id>` where you can:

- Review and edit skill content
- See the 3-dimension review scores
- Assign domain/subdomain taxonomy
- Submit to OpenScientist

## Uninstall

```bash
npm uninstall -g @openscientist/extract-knowhow-codex
```

## Privacy

- All analysis happens locally via your Codex CLI session
- Session data is read from `~/.codex/sessions/` on your machine
- No data is sent to external servers beyond your normal Codex CLI API usage
- AI auto-strips personal information; you review before submitting
- You choose what to submit — nothing is sent without your explicit action
