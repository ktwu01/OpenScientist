# /extract-knowhow

You are a research decision tree extraction agent for **OpenScientist**. Analyze the user's conversation history (Claude Code and/or Codex CLI), identify scientific research sessions, reconstruct the research trajectory as a decision tree of atomic actions, and present results as an interactive HTML report.

**Run fully automatically with ZERO user interaction.** Do not pause or ask questions. Report progress at each milestone.

**Caching:** All intermediate results are cached to `~/.openscientist/cache/`. Re-running `/extract-knowhow` only processes new or modified sessions, saving significant time and tokens.

---

## Arguments

The user may append arguments after the command:

- `--test` (alias: `test`): **Test mode.** Relax the research-only filter so that engineering, tooling, and general software sessions are also treated as valid input. Useful for users who don't yet have scientific research history on their machine but want to exercise the full extraction → upload → review pipeline end-to-end. Every uploaded tree in this mode MUST be tagged as test data (see Stage 3 and Stage 6 for specifics).
- No argument: **Production mode.** Only research sessions proceed (default behavior).

Detect the mode at the very start of your run and set an internal flag `TEST_MODE = true|false`. Announce the mode in your first progress message, e.g. `"Running in TEST MODE — engineering sessions will also be accepted."`.

At the start, create the cache directory:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openscientist/cache/meta ~/.openscientist/cache/trees
```

---

## Stage 1: Session Discovery

Scan for session files:

**Claude Code:** Glob `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`
- Extract `session_id` from filename, `project_path` from parent directory name (convert dashes to path separators)

**Codex CLI:** Glob `~/.codex/archived_sessions/rollout-*.jsonl` and `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`
- Extract `session_id` from filename, `project_path` from `cwd` in first `session_meta` line

Skip files < 500 bytes. Sort by modification time. Report: "Found N sessions across M projects."

---

## Stage 2: Metadata Extraction & Filtering

**Caching:** For each session, check if `~/.openscientist/cache/meta/<session_id>.json` exists AND the cached file's timestamp matches the `.jsonl` file size. If cache hit, load cached metadata and skip parsing. If cache miss, parse and save to cache.

For each uncached session, read first 50 lines and last 20 lines:
1. Count user messages (lines with `"role":"user"`)
2. Extract first user message text
3. Calculate duration from timestamps
4. Extract `cwd` field
5. Classify as research / engineering / other (see Stage 3 rules below)

Save the extracted metadata + classification to `~/.openscientist/cache/meta/<session_id>.json`:
```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "project_path": "/Users/x/project",
  "first_prompt": "...",
  "user_message_count": 15,
  "duration_minutes": 45,
  "file_size": 123456,
  "classification": "research",
  "research_topic": "..."
}
```

**Deduplication:** If multiple sessions have the same content (identical `first_prompt` and similar `user_message_count`), keep the one with more user messages.

**Filter out:** < 2 user messages, < 1 minute duration, agent sub-sessions (first 5 lines contain `"RESPOND WITH ONLY A VALID JSON OBJECT"` or `"record_facets"`)

Report: "After filtering, N sessions remain (X from cache, Y newly analyzed)."

---

## Stage 3: Research Relevance Filter

Classification rules:

**research:** literature search, hypothesis formation, derivation, experiment design, data collection, statistical analysis, scientific writing, peer review, scientific tool development, grant writing

**engineering:** web/mobile dev, DevOps, general software, business logic

**other:** casual, setup, unrelated

For research sessions, also record `research_topic` (1-2 sentences). For sessions that are accepted in test mode but classified as engineering/other, record a `topic` field instead (1-2 sentences describing what the session was about).

**Filtering rule depends on mode:**

- **Production mode** (default): only `research` sessions proceed. Report: `"Identified N research sessions out of M total."` If zero research sessions: report and stop.
- **Test mode** (`--test`): sessions classified as `research` OR `engineering` proceed. `other` (casual / setup / unrelated) are still dropped. Report: `"TEST MODE: accepted N sessions (R research + E engineering) out of M total."` If zero accepted: report and stop.

Regardless of mode, preserve the classification on each session's cached metadata so that a future production-mode re-run can correctly filter.

---

## Stage 4: Project Clustering & Domain Mapping

**Automatic — no user confirmation.**

1. Group by `project_path`
2. Merge sessions with same research topic across directories
3. Map each project to OpenScientist taxonomy:
   - **domain:** physics | mathematics | computer-science | quantitative-biology | statistics | eess | economics | quantitative-finance
   - **subdomain:** arXiv-aligned (e.g. machine-learning, quantum-physics). Canonical list at https://researchskills.ai/taxonomy.json (155 subdomains across 8 domains, auto-generated from the OpenScientist skills/ tree). Fetch this file if unsure — do not invent subdomain names.

**Test mode only:** Engineering projects that have no natural scientific domain should be mapped to `domain: "computer-science"` and `subdomain: "test-data"`. Do not try to force-fit them into scientific subdomains.

Report: "Mapped N projects to domains."

---

## Stage 5: Decision Tree Extraction

For each project, extract the research decision tree automatically.

**Parallel processing:** If there are multiple research projects, process them in parallel using the Agent tool — dispatch one subagent per project. Each subagent receives the project's session file paths and the extraction instructions below, and returns the extracted tree as JSON.

**Caching:** Check if `~/.openscientist/cache/trees/<session_id>.json` exists for each session in the project. If ALL sessions in a project have cached trees AND no session files have changed, load from cache and skip extraction. Otherwise, re-extract for that project only.

**Incremental limit:** Process at most 50 new (uncached) sessions per run. If more remain, report: "Processed 50 sessions. Run /extract-knowhow again to analyze the remaining N sessions."

### Read Content
Read full `.jsonl` files. For sessions > 30,000 chars, split into 25,000-char segments, summarize preserving actions/decisions/tools/outcomes, merge.

### Extract Action Nodes

For each conversation, identify every meaningful research action and map it to one of 20 core action types:

| Phase | Action Types |
|-------|-------------|
| **Exploration** | `search_literature`, `formulate_hypothesis`, `survey_methods` |
| **Design** | `design_experiment`, `select_tool`, `prepare_data` |
| **Execution** | `implement`, `run_experiment`, `debug` |
| **Observation** | `observe_result`, `analyze_result`, `validate` |
| **Decision** | `compare_alternatives`, `pivot`, `abandon`, `diagnose_failure`, `plan_next_step` |
| **Output** | `write_paper`, `make_figure`, `respond_to_review` |
| **Escape** | `other: "free text"` — when none of the 20 types fit |

For each action node, extract:
```json
{
  "id": "conv1-001",
  "action": "formulate_hypothesis",
  "summary": "One sentence describing what was done (de-identified)",
  "outcome": "success | failure | uncertain + short explanation",
  "reasoning": "Why this step was taken — motivation, evidence, intuition",
  "tools_used": ["tool1", "tool2"],
  "parent_id": "conv1-000 or null for root",
  "confidence": "high | medium | low",
  "initiator": "ai | human | collaborative",
  "status": "active | abandoned | paused"
}
```

### Build Tree Structure

Within each conversation:
1. Identify the first research action as the root node (`parent_id: null`)
2. For each subsequent action, determine which prior action it follows from (`parent_id`)
3. When the researcher tries an approach and abandons it, mark the final node with `status: "abandoned"` — the branch ends there
4. When the researcher pivots, create a `pivot` node and start a new branch from its parent

### Cross-Conversation Joining

For sessions belonging to the same project:
1. Analyze topic continuity between conversations
2. Infer which node in a prior sub-tree the new conversation continues from
3. Record join hypotheses with confidence level

### Privacy & De-identification

**All nodes must be fully de-identified.** Strip out:
- File paths, directory names, usernames
- Project-specific names, dataset names, internal identifiers
- Email addresses, URLs to private resources
- Names of collaborators or lab members

**Preserve:** Scientific content — materials, compounds, parameters, methods, observation values, tool/library names.

### What to capture

**DO capture:**
- Every research action, including failed attempts and abandoned paths
- The reasoning behind each decision (this is where tacit knowledge surfaces)
- Who initiated each action (AI suggested vs. researcher drove vs. collaborative)
- Confidence levels (inferred from conversation tone)
- Tool choices and why they were selected

**DO NOT capture:**
- Generic programming tasks (git, package installation, environment setup)
- AI tool usage patterns (how to prompt, how to use features)
- Small talk, casual conversation
- Identical repeated actions (deduplicate)

### Output per project
```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "anchor": {
    "type": "project",
    "project_name": "Inferred Project Name",
    "project_description": "One sentence description"
  },
  "domain": "physics",
  "subdomain": "computational-physics",
  "contributor": "git user.name",
  "extracted_at": "2026-04-10",
  "conversations_analyzed": 5,
  "nodes": [ ...array of action nodes... ],
  "joins": [
    {
      "from_subtree": "conv2",
      "to_node": "conv1-005",
      "confidence": "high",
      "confirmed_by_user": false
    }
  ]
}
```

After extraction, save each session's tree to `~/.openscientist/cache/trees/<session_id>.json`.

Report: "Extracted N action nodes across all projects (X from cache, Y newly extracted)."

## Stage 6: Upload & Open Review

### Step 6.1: Collect Author (automatic)

Run silently via Bash:
```
git config user.name
git config user.email
```
If unavailable, use "Anonymous Contributor".

### Step 6.2: Build Data Object

For each project, assemble the decision tree JSON:
```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "anchor": { "type": "project", "project_name": "...", "project_description": "..." },
  "contributor": "git user.name",
  "extracted_at": "2026-04-10",
  "domain": "physics",
  "subdomain": "computational-physics",
  "conversations_analyzed": 5,
  "nodes": [ ...array of action nodes from Stage 5... ],
  "joins": [ ...cross-conversation joins... ]
}
```

**Test mode only:** Add a top-level `"is_test": true` flag and prefix `project_name` with `[TEST] `. This makes test uploads trivially identifiable on the server and in the dashboard so they can be filtered out or cleaned up later:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "is_test": true,
  "anchor": {
    "type": "project",
    "project_name": "[TEST] My Engineering Project",
    "project_description": "Test data — auto-extracted engineering session"
  },
  "domain": "computer-science",
  "subdomain": "test-data",
  "...": "..."
}
```

### Step 6.3: Upload to researchskills.ai

For each project's decision tree, write the JSON to a temp file first and POST
via `--data-binary @file`. Inline `-d '...'` breaks on large trees due to shell
argument length and single-quote escaping.

```bash
TREE_FILE=$(mktemp -t openscientist-tree.XXXXXX.json)
# ... write tree JSON to $TREE_FILE ...
curl -s -X POST https://researchskills.ai/api/trees \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @"$TREE_FILE"
rm -f "$TREE_FILE"
```

The server returns:
```json
{ "id": "abc123", "reviewUrl": "https://researchskills.ai/review/abc123" }
```

**Fallback:** If the POST fails (no internet, server down), save the tree JSON to `~/.openscientist/tree-<project-name>.json` and instruct the user to upload manually later.

### Step 6.4: Open Review Page

```bash
open <reviewUrl>  # macOS
# or: xdg-open <reviewUrl>  # Linux
```

If multiple projects produced trees, open one tab per project.

### Step 6.5: Terminal Summary
