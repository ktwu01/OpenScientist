<h2 align="center">1. About OpenScientist</h2>

</div>

**Science is the last important problem left for AI to solve.** Real scientific breakthroughs require something no model has: the hard-won intuition of researchers who've spent years at the frontier.

This intuition lives in your head — the know-how, the heuristics, the reasoning patterns, the "I just know this won't work" instinct. It never makes it into papers. It dies when you retire.

**OpenScientist captures it before it's lost.** We turn the tacit knowledge of the world's top researchers — their skills, thinking frameworks, and principles — into reusable AI agent skills (compatible with **Claude Code** and **Codex CLI**). Every contribution makes every AI scientist — now and in the future — smarter, permanently.

Each skill encodes the knowledge, tools, reasoning protocols, and common pitfalls of a scientific field. Skills can be written by domain experts or **auto-extracted from your research conversations** using `/extract-knowhow`. The command extracts three types of cognitive memory from your research sessions — **procedural** (IF-THEN rules for research impasses), **semantic** (facts LLMs don't know), and **episodic** (concrete research episodes) — then packages them as reusable skills. Point your AI agent at a skill, and it reasons like a domain expert.

---

<h2 align="center">2. How to Contribute</h2>

### Method A: Auto-Extract with `/extract-knowhow` (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @openscientist/extract-knowhow
```

**Claude Code:**
```
/extract-knowhow
```

**Codex CLI:**
```
$extract-knowhow
```

The command scans your conversation history and extracts **research skills** organized by cognitive memory type:

- **Procedural memory:** IF-THEN rules for navigating research impasses (e.g., "IF gradient explodes THEN check learning rate before architecture")
- **Semantic memory:** Domain facts that LLMs don't reliably know (e.g., calibration constants, method limitations, undocumented tool behaviors)
- **Episodic memory:** Concrete research episodes capturing what was tried, what failed, and what the researcher learned

An interactive browser review page lets you verify the extracted skills, check de-identification, and bind them to your paper (arXiv/DOI) or project. Submit your skills to OpenScientist, where they become part of a growing knowledge base for building better AI scientists.

### Method B: One-Click Prompt for Web Users (ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini)

Enable memory so the AI can access your history:

| Platform | How to enable | Settings link |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| **ChatGPT** | Settings > Personalization > turn on **Memory** and **Reference chat history** | [Settings](https://chatgpt.com/settings) |
| **Claude** | Settings > Capabilities > turn on **Memory** | [Settings](https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities) |
| **Gemini** | Settings > Personal context > turn on **Your past chats with Gemini** | [Settings](https://gemini.google.com/settings) |

Then paste this prompt into a **new conversation**:

<summary><b>Click to expand the full prompt</b></summary>

```
Review all our past conversations and extract research skills organized by cognitive memory type. Focus exclusively on research activities — ignore general programming, setup, or casual conversations.

Extract three types of research knowledge:

1. **Procedural memory** — IF-THEN rules for navigating research impasses:
   - Format: "IF [situation] THEN [action] BECAUSE [reasoning]"
   - Focus on: decision points, failure recovery, method selection heuristics
   - Example: "IF model loss plateaus after 50 epochs THEN try reducing learning rate by 10x before changing architecture BECAUSE architecture changes are expensive and LR is the most common culprit"

2. **Semantic memory** — Domain facts that LLMs don't reliably know:
   - Calibration constants, undocumented tool behaviors, method limitations
   - Example: "Library X's default tokenizer silently truncates inputs over 512 tokens without warning"

3. **Episodic memory** — Concrete research episodes:
   - What was tried, what failed, what was learned
   - Include dead ends and abandoned approaches — these are the most valuable

For each skill, include:
- The research context (what problem was being solved)
- The domain/subdomain (e.g., physics/quantum-physics)
- Confidence level: high | medium | low

Output as a markdown document with sections for each memory type.

Rules:
- Extract the FULL research trajectory, including dead ends and abandoned paths
- DE-IDENTIFY all output: remove file paths, usernames, project names, private URLs, collaborator names. Keep scientific content (materials, parameters, methods)
- Focus on capturing the reasoning and judgment behind each action — the kind of intuition that never makes it into papers
- DO NOT skip failed attempts or abandoned directions — they reveal tacit knowledge
- DO NOT extract generic programming knowledge, AI tool usage patterns, or textbook basics
- After the output, ask if there are research conversations that were missed
```

<h2 align="center">3. Skill Architecture</h2>

OpenScientist skills are grounded in cognitive architecture theory — [Soar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soar_(cognitive_architecture)) (Laird, 2012), [ACT-R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT-R) (Anderson, 1996), and [Case-Based Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-based_reasoning) (Kolodner, 1993). Skills are organized by **how researchers' minds actually store and retrieve expertise**, not by arbitrary categories.

### Three Memory Types

| Type | What it stores | When it triggers |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Procedural** | IF-THEN rules for research impasses | Agent faces a decision, gets stuck, or assumptions fail |
| **Semantic** | Facts missing from LLM training data | Agent needs domain knowledge it doesn't have |
| **Episodic** | Concrete research episodes | Agent encounters a situation similar to a past experience |

### Procedural Memory — "How to decide"

Classified by the type of **research impasse** (adapted from Soar's impasse taxonomy):

| Subtype | Impasse | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `tie` | Multiple paths, unclear which to choose | "Ablation vs. full retrain — which first?" |
| `no-change` | Completely stuck, no idea what to do next | "Results are bizarre, nothing makes sense" |
| `constraint-failure` | A methodological assumption doesn't hold | "Data violates i.i.d. assumption" |
| `operator-fail` | Chose the right approach but execution fails | "Correct method, but CUDA OOM on large batch" |

Each procedural skill contains: **When** (trigger condition + exclusions) → **Decision** (preferred action + rejected alternatives + reasoning) → **Local Verifiers** (how to check) → **Failure Handling** (what if it doesn't work) → **Anti-exemplars** (when NOT to use this).

### Semantic Memory — "What LLMs don't know"

Only three sub-types qualify — everything else is redundant with LLM training data:

| Subtype | What it stores | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| `frontier` | Post-training-cutoff knowledge | "Flash Attention 3 renamed the `causal` parameter" |
| `non-public` | Lab-internal, unpublished knowledge | "This vendor's H100 batch has NCCL topology issues" |
| `correction` | Fixes for LLM's incorrect default beliefs | "Adam eps=1e-8 is unstable for mixed-precision; use 1e-5" |

### Episodic Memory — "What happened"

Classified using Case-Based Reasoning terminology:

| Subtype | Signal | Retrieval trigger |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| `failure` | "Did X, broke because of hidden reason Y" | Agent is about to do something similar |
| `adaptation` | "Standard method failed, but workaround Z worked" | Agent is stuck with the standard approach |
| `anomalous` | "Expected A, observed B — turned out to be important" | Agent observes a similar anomaly |
