<h2 align="center">1. About OpenScientist</h2>

</div>

### 1.1 What is it

**Science is the last important problem left for AI to solve.** Code, law, design — AI already handles these. But real scientific breakthroughs require something no model has: the hard-won intuition of researchers who've spent years at the frontier.

This intuition lives in your head — the know-how, the heuristics, the reasoning patterns, the "I just know this won't work" instinct. It never makes it into papers. It dies when you retire.

**OpenScientist captures it before it's lost.** We turn the tacit knowledge of the world's top researchers — their skills, thinking frameworks, and principles — into reusable AI agent skills (compatible with **Claude Code** and **Codex CLI**). Every contribution makes every AI scientist — now and in the future — smarter, permanently.

### 1.2 How it works

Each skill encodes the knowledge, tools, reasoning protocols, and common pitfalls of a scientific field. Skills can be written by domain experts or **auto-extracted from your research conversations** using `/extract-knowhow`. Point your AI agent at a skill, and it reasons like a domain expert.

### 1.3 What can you do

Contribute your expertise, or use this repo to supercharge your AI agent's scientific discovery.

### 1.4 Open Source & Non-Profit

OpenScientist is a fully open-source, non-profit initiative. As the project grows, we plan to establish a non-profit organization (NGO) to ensure long-term governance, transparency, and stewardship of all contributed knowledge.

### 1.5 Why should you contribute?

Turning your know-how into AI-reusable knowledge means:

- **Boost your own research efficiency** — your AI agent gains your expertise and works alongside you
- **Boost humanity's research efficiency** — every scientist benefits from the collective knowledge
- **Survive the Singularity** — when ASI takes over, your contribution to this repo might just save your life

<h2 align="center">3. How to Contribute</h2>

### 3.1 Contributor Requirements

> **Who can contribute?** We maintain a high bar for scientific accuracy.

- **Academic credential** — PhD degree or equivalent research position (postdoc, research scientist, professor, etc.) is **required**
- **Real-name identity** — Contributors must use their real name and institutional affiliation in the `author` field (e.g., `"Dr. Albert Einstein (ETH Zürich Physics)"`)
- **Domain expertise** — You may only contribute skills within your area of professional expertise

### 3.2 Method A: Auto-Extract with `/extract-knowhow` (Recommended)

Let AI analyze your conversation history and automatically generate skill files from your research know-how:

```bash
npm install -g @openscientist/extract-knowhow
```

Then run:

**Claude Code:**
```
/extract-knowhow
```

**Codex CLI:**
```
$extract-knowhow
```

The command will:
1. Scan your conversation history automatically
2. Filter to research-related sessions only
3. Cluster by project and map to scientific domains
4. Extract reusable know-how across 10 categories
5. Open an interactive HTML report in your browser
6. You review, edit, accept/reject skills in the browser
7. Click "Save Approved Skills" → go back to terminal
8. Claude Code / Codex CLI auto-submits to OpenScientist via GitHub Issues

### 3.3 Method B: One-Click Prompt for Web Users (ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini)

Works with any AI chat that can reference your past conversations. First, enable memory so the AI can access your history:

| Platform | How to enable | Settings link |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| **ChatGPT** | Settings > Personalization > turn on **Memory** and **Reference chat history** | [Settings](https://chatgpt.com/settings) |
| **Claude** | Settings > Capabilities > turn on **Memory** | [Settings](https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities) |
| **Gemini** | Settings > Personal context > turn on **Your past chats with Gemini** | [Settings](https://gemini.google.com/settings) |

Then paste this prompt into a **new conversation**:

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand the full prompt</b></summary>

```
Review all our past conversations and extract every piece of reusable scientific research know-how. Focus exclusively on research activities — ignore general programming, setup, or casual conversations.

For each piece of know-how you find, classify it into one of these 10 categories:
1. Literature Search — search strategies, paper filtering, citation analysis
2. Hypothesis & Ideation — hypothesis formation, research question development
3. Math & Modeling — proof strategies, derivations, mathematical formulations
4. Experiment Planning — protocols, control strategies, variable selection
5. Data Acquisition — data sources, cleaning pipelines, labeling strategies
6. Coding & Execution — research coding patterns, library choices, debugging
7. Result Analysis — statistical methods, visualization, interpretation
8. Reusable Tooling — tools, methods, or workflows you helped me build
9. Paper Writing — writing structure, figure standards, claim formulation
10. Review & Rebuttal — self-critique, reviewer responses, revision strategies

Output each item in a SINGLE code block using this exact format, so I can copy-paste it directly:

---

<h2 align="center">6. How We Work</h2>

### 6.1 Issue templates


| Template                                                                                                               | When to use                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| [Submit a Skill](https://github.com/OpenScientists/OpenScientist/issues/new?template=submit-skill.yml)                 | Submit a skill (from `/extract-knowhow` or manually written) |
| [Skill Request](https://github.com/OpenScientists/OpenScientist/issues/new?template=skill-request.yml)                 | Need a skill but can't write it yourself |
| [Reviewer Application](https://github.com/OpenScientists/OpenScientist/issues/new?template=maintainer-application.yml) | Apply to become a subdomain reviewer     |
| [Propose New Area](https://github.com/OpenScientists/OpenScientist/issues/new?template=propose-new-area.md)            | Propose a new top-level domain           |

### 6.2 Skill submission workflow

1. Contributor submits a skill via [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/OpenScientists/OpenScientist/issues/new?template=submit-skill.yml) (or opens a PR)
2. Subdomain reviewer checks scientific accuracy
3. Maintainer adds the skill file to the repo
4. Skill status starts as `draft`

**Status lifecycle:** `draft` → `reviewed` (reviewer approves) → `verified` (tested in a real AI workflow)

### 6.3 Automated reviewer onboarding

When a Reviewer Application issue receives the `approved` label, the [onboard-maintainer](/.github/workflows/onboard-maintainer.yml) workflow automatically:

- Adds the reviewer to `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- Adds their name to the [Knowledge Tree](https://openscientists.github.io/OpenScientist/) and [Reviewers page](https://openscientists.github.io/OpenScientist/reviewers.html)
- Closes the issue with a welcome comment

### 6.4 CODEOWNERS & review assignment

Each `skills/<domain>/<subdomain>/` path maps to a reviewer in [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS). PRs touching that path automatically request the assigned reviewer. Unclaimed subdomains fall back to `@HHHHHejia`.
