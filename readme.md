<h2 align="center">1. About OpenScientist</h2>

</div>

**Science is the last important problem left for AI to solve.** Real scientific breakthroughs require something no model has: the hard-won intuition of researchers who've spent years at the frontier.

This intuition lives in your head — the know-how, the heuristics, the reasoning patterns, the "I just know this won't work" instinct. It never makes it into papers. It dies when you retire.

**OpenScientist captures it before it's lost.** We turn the tacit knowledge of the world's top researchers — their skills, thinking frameworks, and principles — into reusable AI agent skills (compatible with **Claude Code** and **Codex**). Every contribution makes every AI scientist — now and in the future — smarter, permanently.

Each skill encodes the knowledge, tools, reasoning protocols, and common pitfalls of a scientific field. Skills can be written by domain experts or **auto-extracted from your research conversations** using `/extract-knowhow`. The command extracts three types of cognitive memory from your research sessions — **procedural** (IF-THEN rules for research impasses), **semantic** (facts LLMs don't know), and **episodic** (concrete research episodes) — then packages them as reusable skills. Point your AI agent at a skill, and it reasons like a domain expert.

---

<h2 align="center">2. How to Contribute</h2>

### Method A: Auto-Extract with `/extract-knowhow` (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @openscientist/extract-knowhow
```

**Claude Code:**
```
/extract-knowhow
```

**Codex** (start with `codex -a never -s danger-full-access`):
```
$extract-knowhow
```

> 💡 **For best results:** use the most powerful model with the highest reasoning effort — **Claude Code:** Opus 4.6 + max effort. **Codex:** GPT-5.4 + x-high. Don't worry about token usage — conversations are heavily compressed before analysis, and the per-session extraction is delegated to lighter models behind the scenes. Your chosen model mainly orchestrates the pipeline.

The command scans your conversation history and extracts **research skills** organized by cognitive memory type:

- **Procedural memory:** IF-THEN rules for navigating research impasses (e.g., "IF gradient explodes THEN check learning rate before architecture")
- **Semantic memory:** Domain facts that LLMs don't reliably know (e.g., calibration constants, method limitations, undocumented tool behaviors)
- **Episodic memory:** Concrete research episodes capturing what was tried, what failed, and what the researcher learned

An interactive browser review page lets you verify the extracted skills, check de-identification, and bind them to your paper (arXiv/DOI) or project. Submit your skills to OpenScientist, where they become part of a growing knowledge base for building better AI scientists.

### Method B: One-Click Prompt for Web Users (ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini)

Enable memory so the AI can access your history:

| Platform | How to enable | Settings link |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| **ChatGPT** | Settings > Personalization > turn on **Memory** and **Reference chat history** | [Settings](https://chatgpt.com/settings) |
| **Claude** | Settings > Capabilities > turn on **Memory** | [Settings](https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities) |
| **Gemini** | Settings > Personal context > turn on **Your past chats with Gemini** | [Settings](https://gemini.google.com/settings) |

Then paste this prompt into a **new conversation**:

````
You have access to my full conversation history. Review ALL of it and extract **research skills** — the tacit know-how from my scientific work that a frontier LLM doesn't already know. Be comprehensive, not selective: a typical researcher accumulates dozens of worthwhile skills across a year of conversations.

## Three memory types (with required subtypes)

Pick exactly ONE subtype per skill. If nothing fits, don't force it — skip.

### 1. Procedural — IF-THEN rules for research impasses
- `tie` — multiple viable paths, unclear which to try first (e.g., "ablation vs. full retrain?")
- `no-change` — completely stuck, no hypothesis about what to try (e.g., "results are bizarre, nothing makes sense")
- `constraint-failure` — a methodological assumption breaks (e.g., "data violates i.i.d.")
- `operator-fail` — right method chosen, execution fails (e.g., "CUDA OOM at large batch")

### 2. Semantic — Facts a frontier LLM doesn't reliably know
- `frontier` — post-training-cutoff knowledge (e.g., "Flash Attention 3 renamed the `causal` parameter")
- `non-public` — lab-internal or unpublished findings (e.g., "this H100 batch has NCCL topology issues")
- `correction` — fixes for an incorrect LLM default belief (e.g., "Adam eps=1e-8 is unstable under fp16; use 1e-5")

### 3. Episodic — Concrete episodes with a transferable lesson
- `failure` — "did X, broke because of hidden reason Y"
- `adaptation` — "standard method failed; workaround Z worked"
- `anomalous` — "expected A, observed B — turned out to be important"

## Hard filters (DO NOT extract)

- Engineering / DevOps / deployment / CI / UI / database / Docker
- Generic programming: git, npm, React, debugging build errors
- Textbook knowledge any LLM knows
- Casual chat, setup, file organization, project naming

A skill that an LLM could have generated itself is worth zero. Only extract what **corrects or extends** what a frontier model already knows.

## Output format

For each skill, output ONE YAML+markdown block separated by `===`:

```
---
name: gradient-explosion-under-fp16
memory_type: procedural
subtype: operator-fail
domain: computer-science      # arXiv top-level: physics, math, computer-science, q-bio, stat, eess, econ, q-fin
subdomain: machine-learning   # see https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy
tags: [adam, mixed-precision, numerical-stability]
---

## When
Training deep transformers with Adam under fp16; loss spikes to NaN within the first few epochs despite gradient clipping.

## Decision
Raise Adam's `eps` from 1e-8 to 1e-5 BEFORE lowering the learning rate or touching architecture. Rejected: lowering LR (masks the symptom), switching to SGD (loses Adam's benefits).

## Why
At fp16 resolution, 1e-8 denormalizes to zero, so Adam's update divides by ~0. Most "gradient explosion" under mixed precision is this, not true instability.

## Local Verifiers
- NaN appears in optimizer state BEFORE gradient clipping fires
- Symptom disappears under bf16 (wider dynamic range) — confirms the eps hypothesis

## Anti-exemplars
Don't apply if using bf16 or fp32 — eps=1e-8 is fine there.
===
```

## Rules

- **De-identify**: strip file paths, usernames, project names, private URLs, collaborator names. KEEP scientific content (materials, parameters, methods, model names).
- **Dead ends are gold**: failed experiments and abandoned approaches are often the most valuable skills. Don't skip them.
- **Favor specificity**: "IF loss plateaus THEN try X" is weak. "IF Adam loss plateaus on transformers >1B params after warmup THEN X because Y" is strong.
- **Aim for coverage, not brevity**: if you only found 3 skills across a year of research conversations, you missed most of them.

<h2 align="center">3. Skill Architecture</h2>

OpenScientist skills are grounded in cognitive architecture theory — [Soar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soar_(cognitive_architecture)) (Laird, 2012), [ACT-R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT-R) (Anderson, 1996), and [Case-Based Reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-based_reasoning) (Kolodner, 1993). Skills are organized by **how researchers' minds actually store and retrieve expertise**, not by arbitrary categories.

### Three Memory Types

| Type | What it stores | When it triggers |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Procedural** | IF-THEN rules for research impasses | Agent faces a decision, gets stuck, or assumptions fail |
| **Semantic** | Facts missing from LLM training data | Agent needs domain knowledge it doesn't have |
| **Episodic** | Concrete research episodes | Agent encounters a situation similar to a past experience |

### Procedural Memory — "How to decide"

Classified by the type of **research impasse** (adapted from Soar's impasse taxonomy):

| Subtype | Impasse | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `tie` | Multiple paths, unclear which to choose | "Ablation vs. full retrain — which first?" |
| `no-change` | Completely stuck, no idea what to do next | "Results are bizarre, nothing makes sense" |
| `constraint-failure` | A methodological assumption doesn't hold | "Data violates i.i.d. assumption" |
| `operator-fail` | Chose the right approach but execution fails | "Correct method, but CUDA OOM on large batch" |

Each procedural skill contains: **When** (trigger condition + exclusions) → **Decision** (preferred action + rejected alternatives + reasoning) → **Local Verifiers** (how to check) → **Failure Handling** (what if it doesn't work) → **Anti-exemplars** (when NOT to use this).

### Semantic Memory — "What LLMs don't know"

Only three sub-types qualify — everything else is redundant with LLM training data:

| Subtype | What it stores | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| `frontier` | Post-training-cutoff knowledge | "Flash Attention 3 renamed the `causal` parameter" |
| `non-public` | Lab-internal, unpublished knowledge | "This vendor's H100 batch has NCCL topology issues" |
| `correction` | Fixes for LLM's incorrect default beliefs | "Adam eps=1e-8 is unstable for mixed-precision; use 1e-5" |

### Episodic Memory — "What happened"

Classified using Case-Based Reasoning terminology:

| Subtype | Signal | Retrieval trigger |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| `failure` | "Did X, broke because of hidden reason Y" | Agent is about to do something similar |
| `adaptation` | "Standard method failed, but workaround Z worked" | Agent is stuck with the standard approach |
| `anomalous` | "Expected A, observed B — turned out to be important" | Agent observes a similar anomaly |
