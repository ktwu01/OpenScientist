## Situation
A scientific review draft in land surface modeling looked broadly complete on historical development and ML-vs-physics framing, but external review notes suggested deeper scientific omissions.

## Action
The draft was checked for explicit presence of frontier model lines and benchmark programs by scanning for named concepts rather than only rereading prose. The check targeted differentiable-model terms and benchmark ecosystems such as PLUMBER/PLUMBER2, ILAMB, and LS3MIP.

## Outcome
The scan exposed that the scientifically important gaps were not generic prose weaknesses but missing coverage of differentiable modeling and benchmark-centered evaluation. Revisions then focused on those omissions.

## Lesson
For review articles, sparse or absent mentions of field-defining named programs can be a fast detector of conceptual incompleteness. A named-entity coverage check can outperform unguided rereading when the real problem is missing scientific scope.

## Retrieval Cues
- Revising a review article after high-level critique
- Draft seems complete but reviewer says key advances are underplayed
- Field has recognizable benchmark consortia or protocol names
- Frontier subfields may be missing even when the historical narrative is strong
